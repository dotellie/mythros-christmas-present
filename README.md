# A Christmas present for Mythros
I decided to participate in the secret Santa game on the WaniKani forums this Christmas. When I saw Mythros (who I was secret Santa for) liked short stories, I decided to make a short little interactive Christmas story for him.

## About the technology
The game is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's decently modular, so feel free to modify it and make your own version of it.
